# Getting Started with Axiom

Welcome! This skill helps new users discover the most relevant Axiom skills for their situation.

## How This Skill Works

1. Ask the user 2-3 targeted questions about their project
2. Provide personalized skill recommendations (3-5 skills max)
3. Show example prompts they can try immediately
4. Include a complete skill reference for browsing

## Step 1: Ask Questions

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather context:

### Question 1: Current Focus

```
Question: "What brings you to Axiom today?"
Header: "Focus"
Options:
- "Debugging an issue" → Prioritize diagnostic skills
- "Optimizing performance" → Prioritize profiling skills
- "Adding new features" → Prioritize reference skills
- "Code review / quality check" → Prioritize audit commands
- "Just exploring" → Show overview
```

### Question 2: Tech Stack

```
Question: "What's your primary tech stack?"
Header: "Stack"
Options:
- "SwiftUI (iOS 16+)" → SwiftUI-focused skills
- "UIKit" → UIKit-focused skills
- "Mixed SwiftUI + UIKit" → Both
- "Starting new project" → Best practices skills
```

### Question 3: Pain Points (Optional, Multi-Select)

Only ask if "Debugging an issue" was selected:

```
Question: "Which areas are you struggling with?"
Header: "Pain Points"
Multi-select: true
Options:
- "Xcode/build issues"
- "Memory leaks"
- "UI/animation problems"
- "Database/persistence"
- "Networking"
- "Concurrency/async"
- "Accessibility"
```

## Step 2: Provide Personalized Recommendations

Based on answers, recommend 3-5 skills using this matrix:

### If "Debugging an issue"

**Always recommend**: axiom:xcode-debugging (universal starting point)

**Then add based on pain points**:
- Xcode/build → xcode-debugging, axiom-build-debugging
- Memory leaks → memory-debugging, axiom-objc-block-retain-cycles
- UI/animation (SwiftUI) → swiftui-debugging, axiom-swiftui-performance
- UI/animation (UIKit) → uikit-animation-debugging, axiom-auto-layout-debugging
- Database → database-migration, axiom-sqlitedata-migration (decision guide)
- Networking → networking, axiom-networking-diag
- Concurrency → swift-concurrency
- Accessibility → accessibility-diag

### If "Optimizing performance"

**SwiftUI stack**:
1. performance-profiling (decision trees for tools)
2. swiftui-performance (SwiftUI Instrument)
3. swiftui-debugging (view update issues)

**UIKit/Mixed**:
1. performance-profiling (Instruments guide)
2. memory-debugging (leak detection)
3. uikit-animation-debugging (CAAnimation issues)

### If "Adding new features"

**Design decisions**:
- hig (quick design decisions, checklists)
- hig-ref (comprehensive HIG reference)

**iOS 26+ features**:
- liquid-glass (material design system)
- foundation-models (on-device AI)
- swiftui-26-ref (complete iOS 26 guide)

**Navigation patterns**:
- swiftui-nav (iOS 18+ Tab/Sidebar, deep linking)
- swiftui-nav-ref (comprehensive API reference)

**Integrations**:
- app-intents-ref (Siri, Shortcuts, Spotlight)
- networking (Network.framework modern patterns)

**Data persistence**:
- Ask: "Which persistence framework?" → swiftdata, axiom-sqlitedata, or grdb
- Migration: axiom-sqlitedata-migration, axiom-realm-migration-ref

### If "Code review / quality check"

**Start with audit commands** (quick wins):
1. `/axiom:audit-accessibility` — WCAG compliance
2. `/axiom:audit-concurrency` — Swift 6 violations
3. `/axiom:audit-memory` — Leak patterns
4. `/axiom:audit-core-data` — Migration safety
5. `/axiom:audit-networking` — Deprecated APIs

**Then suggest**:
- Review skills based on what audits find

### If "Just exploring"

Show the complete skill index (see below) and explain categories.

## Step 3: Output Format

After gathering answers, output:

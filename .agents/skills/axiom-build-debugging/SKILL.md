# Build Debugging

## Overview

Check dependencies BEFORE blaming code. **Core principle** 80% of persistent build failures are dependency resolution issues (CocoaPods, SPM, framework conflicts), not code bugs.

## Example Prompts

These are real questions developers ask that this skill is designed to answer:

#### 1. "I added a Swift Package but I'm getting 'No such module' errors. The package is in my Xcode project but won't compile."
→ The skill covers SPM resolution workflows, package cache clearing, and framework search path diagnostics

#### 2. "The build is failing with 'Multiple commands produce' the same output file. How do I figure out which files are duplicated?"
→ The skill shows how to identify duplicate target membership and resolve file conflicts in build settings

#### 3. "CocoaPods installed dependencies successfully but the build still fails. How do I debug CocoaPods issues?"
→ The skill covers Podfile.lock conflict resolution, linking errors, and version constraint debugging

#### 4. "My build works on my Mac but fails on the CI server. Both machines have the latest Xcode. What's different?"
→ The skill explains dependency caching differences, environment-specific paths, and reproducible build strategies

#### 5. "I'm getting framework version conflicts and I don't know which dependency is causing it. How do I resolve this?"
→ The skill demonstrates dependency graph analysis and version constraint resolution strategies for complex dependency trees

## Red Flags — Dependency/Build Issues

If you see ANY of these, suspect dependency problem:
- "No such module" after adding package
- "Multiple commands produce" same output file
- Build succeeds on one machine, fails on another
- CocoaPods install succeeds but build fails
- SPM resolution takes forever or times out
- Framework version conflicts in error logs

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Build failing?
├─ "No such module XYZ"?
│  ├─ After adding SPM package?
│  │  └─ Clean build folder + reset package caches
│  ├─ After pod install?
│  │  └─ Check Podfile.lock conflicts
│  └─ Framework not found?
│     └─ Check FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS
├─ "Multiple commands produce"?
│  └─ Duplicate files in target membership
├─ SPM resolution hangs?
│  └─ Clear package caches + derived data
└─ Version conflicts?
   └─ Use dependency resolution strategies below
```

## Common Build Issues

### Issue 1: SPM Package Not Found

**Symptom**: "No such module PackageName" after adding Swift Package

**❌ WRONG**:
```bash
# Rebuilding without cleaning
xcodebuild build
```

**✅ CORRECT**:
```bash
# Reset package caches first
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm

# Reset packages in project
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies

# Clean build
xcodebuild clean build -scheme YourScheme
```

### Issue 2: CocoaPods Conflicts

**Symptom**: Pod install succeeds but build fails with framework errors

**Check Podfile.lock**:
```bash
# See what versions were actually installed
cat Podfile.lock | grep -A 2 "PODS:"

# Compare with Podfile requirements
cat Podfile | grep "pod "
```

**Fix version conflicts**:
```ruby
# Podfile - be explicit about versions
pod 'Alamofire', '~> 5.8.0'  # Not just 'Alamofire'
pod 'SwiftyJSON', '5.0.1'     # Exact version if needed
```

**Clean reinstall**:
```bash
# Remove all pods
rm -rf Pods/
rm Podfile.lock

# Reinstall
pod install

# Open workspace (not project!)
open YourApp.xcworkspace
```

### Issue 3: Multiple Commands Produce Error

**Symptom**: "Multiple commands produce '/path/to/file'"

**Cause**: Same file added to multiple targets or build phases

**Fix**:
1. Open Xcode
2. Select file in navigator
3. File Inspector → Target Membership
4. Uncheck duplicate targets
5. Or: Build Phases → Copy Bundle Resources → remove duplicates

### Issue 4: Framework Search Paths

**Symptom**: "Framework not found" or "Linker command failed"

**Check build settings**:
```bash
# Show all build settings
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -scheme YourScheme | grep FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS
```

**Fix in Xcode**:
1. Target → Build Settings
2. Search "Framework Search Paths"
3. Add path: `$(PROJECT_DIR)/Frameworks` (recursive)
4. Or: `$(inherited)` to inherit from project

### Issue 5: SPM Version Conflicts

**Symptom**: Package resolution fails with version conflicts

**See dependency graph**:
```bash
# In project directory
swift package show-dependencies

# Or see resolved versions
cat Package.resolved
```

**Fix conflicts**:
```swift
// Package.swift - be explicit
.package(url: "https://github.com/owner/repo", exact: "1.2.3")  // Exact version
.package(url: "https://github.com/owner/repo", from: "1.2.0")   // Minimum version
.package(url: "https://github.com/owner/repo", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))  // SemVer
```

**Reset resolution**:
```bash
# Clear package caches
rm -rf .build
rm Package.resolved

# Re-resolve
swift package resolve
```

## Dependency Resolution Strategies

### Strategy 1: Lock to Specific Versions

When stability matters more than latest features:

**CocoaPods**:
```ruby
pod 'Alamofire', '5.8.0'      # Exact version
pod 'SwiftyJSON', '~> 5.0.0'  # Any 5.0.x
```

**SPM**:
```swift
.package(url: "...", exact: "1.2.3")
```

### Strategy 2: Use Version Ranges

When you want bug fixes but not breaking changes:

**CocoaPods**:
```ruby
pod 'Alamofire', '~> 5.8'     # 5.8.x but not 5.9
pod 'SwiftyJSON', '>= 5.0', '< 6.0'  # Range
```

**SPM**:
```swift
.package(url: "...", from: "1.2.0")              // 1.2.0 and higher
.package(url: "...", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))  // 1.x.x but not 2.0.0
```

### Strategy 3: Fork and Pin

When you need custom modifications:

```bash
# Fork repo on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourname/package.git

# In Package.swift, use your fork
.package(url: "https://github.com/yourname/package", branch: "custom-fixes")
```

### Strategy 4: Exclude Transitive Dependencies

When a dependency's dependency conflicts:

**SPM (not directly supported, use workarounds)**:
```swift
// Instead of this:
.package(url: "https://github.com/problematic/package")

// Fork it and remove the conflicting dependency from its Package.swift
```

**CocoaPods**:
```ruby
# Exclude specific subspecs
pod 'Firebase/Core'  # Not all of Firebase
pod 'Firebase/Analytics'
```

## Build Configuration Issues

### Debug vs Release Differences

**Symptom**: Builds in Debug, fails in Release (or vice versa)

**Check optimization settings**:
```bash
# Compare Debug and Release settings
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -configuration Debug > debug.txt
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -configuration Release > release.txt
diff debug.txt release.txt
```

**Common culprits**:
- SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL (-Onone vs -O)
- ENABLE_TESTABILITY (YES in Debug, NO in Release)
- DEBUG preprocessor flag
- Code signing settings

### Workspace vs Project

**Always open workspace with CocoaPods**:
```bash
# ❌ WRONG
open YourApp.xcodeproj

# ✅ CORRECT
open YourApp.xcworkspace
```

**Check which you're building**:
```bash
# For workspace
xcodebuild -workspace YourApp.xcworkspace -scheme YourScheme build

# For project only (no CocoaPods)
xcodebuild -project YourApp.xcodeproj -scheme YourScheme build
```

## Pressure Scenarios: When to Resist "Quick Fix" Advice

### The Problem

Under deadline pressure, senior engineers and teammates provide "quick fixes" based on pattern-matching:
- "Just regenerate the lock file"
- "Increment the build number"
- "Delete DerivedData and rebuild"

These feel safe because they come from experience. **But if the diagnosis is wrong, the fix wastes time you don't have.**

**Critical insight** Time pressure makes authority bias STRONGER. You're more likely to trust advice when stressed.

### Red Flags — STOP Before Acting

If you hear ANY of these, pause 5 minutes before executing:

- ❌ **"This smells like..."** (pattern-matching, not diagnosis)
- ❌ **"Just..."** (underestimating complexity)
- ❌ **"This usually fixes it"** (worked once ≠ works always)
- ❌ **"You have plenty of time"** (overconfidence about 24-hour turnaround)
- ❌ **"This is safe"** (regenerating lock files CAN break things)

**Your brain under pressure** Trusts these phrases because they sound confident. Doesn't ask "but do they have evidence THIS is the root cause?"

### Mandatory Diagnosis Before "Quick Fix"

When someone senior suggests a fix under time pressure:

#### Step 1: Ask (Don't argue)
```
"I understand the pressure. Before we regenerate lock files,
can we spend 5 minutes comparing the broken build to our
working build? I want to know what we're fixing."
```

#### Step 2: Demand Evidence
- "What makes you think it's a lock file issue?"
- "What changed between our last successful build and this failure?"
- "Can we see the actual error from App Store build vs our build?"

#### Step 3: Document the Gamble
```
If we try "pod install":
- Time to execute: 10 minutes
- Time to learn it failed: 24 hours (next submission cycle)
- Remaining time if it fails: 6 days
- Alternative: Spend 1-2 hours diagnosing first

Cost of being wrong with quick fix: High
Cost of spending 1 hour on diagnosis: Low
```

#### Step 4: Push Back Professionally
```
"I want to move fast too. A 1-hour diagnosis now means we
won't waste another 24-hour cycle. Let's document what we're
testing before we submit."
```

#### Why this works
- You're not questioning their expertise
- You're asking for evidence (legitimate request)
- You're showing you understand the pressure
- You're making the time math visible

### Real-World Example: App Store Review Blocker

**Scenario** App rejected in App Store build, passes locally.

**Senior says** "Regenerate lock file and resubmit (7 days buffer)"

#### What you do
1. ❌ WRONG: Execute immediately, fail after 24 hours, now 6 days left
2. ✅ RIGHT: Spend 1 hour comparing builds first

#### Comparison checklist
```
Local build that works:
- Pod versions in Podfile.lock: [list them]
- Xcode version: [version]
- Derived Data: [timestamp]
- CocoaPods version: [version]

App Store build that fails:
- Pod versions used: [from error message]
- Build system: [App Store's environment]
- Differences: [explicitly document]
```

#### After comparison
- If versions match: Lock file isn't the issue. Skip the quick fix.
- If versions differ: Now you understand what to fix.

**Time saved** 24 hours of wasted iteration.

### When to Trust Quick Fixes (Rare)

Quick fixes are safe ONLY when:

- [ ] You've seen this EXACT error before (not "similar")
- [ ] You know the root cause (not "this usually works")
- [ ] You can reproduce it locally (so you know if fix worked)
- [ ] You have >48 hours buffer (so failure costs less)
- [ ] You documented the fix in case you need to explain it later

#### In production crises, NONE of these are usually true.

## Testing Checklist

### When Adding Dependencies
- [ ] Specify exact versions or ranges (not just latest)
- [ ] Check for known conflicts with existing deps
- [ ] Test clean build after adding
- [ ] Commit lockfile (Podfile.lock or Package.resolved)

### When Builds Fail
- [ ] Run mandatory environment checks (xcode-debugging skill)
- [ ] Check dependency lockfiles for changes
- [ ] Verify using correct workspace/project file
- [ ] Compare working vs broken build settings

### Before Shipping
- [ ] Test both Debug and Release builds
- [ ] Verify all dependencies have compatible licenses
- [ ] Check binary size impact of dependencies
- [ ] Test on clean machine or CI

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Not Committing Lockfiles
```bash
# ❌ BAD: .gitignore includes lockfiles
Podfile.lock
Package.resolved
```

**Why**: Team members get different versions, builds differ

### ❌ Using "Latest" Version
```ruby
# ❌ BAD: No version specified
pod 'Alamofire'
```

**Why**: Breaking changes when dependency updates

### ❌ Mixing Package Managers
```
Project uses both:
- CocoaPods (Podfile)
- Carthage (Cartfile)
- SPM (Package.swift)
```

**Why**: Conflicts are inevitable, pick one primary manager

### ❌ Not Cleaning After Dependency Changes
```bash
# ❌ BAD: Just rebuild
xcodebuild build

# ✅ GOOD: Clean first
xcodebuild clean build
```

### ❌ Opening Project Instead of Workspace
When using CocoaPods, always open .xcworkspace not .xcodeproj

## Command Reference

```bash
# CocoaPods
pod install                    # Install dependencies
pod update                     # Update to latest versions
pod update PodName             # Update specific pod
pod outdated                   # Check for updates
pod deintegrate                # Remove CocoaPods from project

# Swift Package Manager
swift package resolve          # Resolve dependencies
swift package update           # Update dependencies
swift package show-dependencies # Show dependency tree
swift package reset            # Reset package cache
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies  # Xcode's SPM resolve

# Carthage
carthage update                # Update dependencies
carthage bootstrap             # Download pre-built frameworks
carthage build --platform iOS  # Build for specific platform

# Xcode Build
xcodebuild clean               # Clean build folder
xcodebuild -list               # List schemes and targets
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings  # Show all build settings
```

## Real-World Impact

**Before** (trial-and-error with dependencies):
- Dependency issue: 2-4 hours debugging
- Clean builds not run consistently
- Version conflicts surprise team
- CI failures from dependency mismatches

**After** (systematic dependency management):
- Dependency issue: 15-30 minutes (check lockfile → resolve)
- Clean builds mandatory after dep changes
- Explicit version constraints prevent surprises
- CI matches local builds (committed lockfiles)

**Key insight** Lock down dependency versions early. Flexibility causes more problems than it solves.

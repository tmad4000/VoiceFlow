Not a 'gold rush' market but sustainable business possible with right positioning. Best opportunities in underserved niches (e.g., specific professions, AI-first, Apple-native premium).",

    "Consider freemium with strong free tier to build base",
    "Build for word-of-mouth (exceptional UX, unique value)",

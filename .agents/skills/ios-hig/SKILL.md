# iOS Human Interface Guidelines

Apple's Human Interface Guidelines define the visual language, interaction patterns, and accessibility standards that make iOS apps feel native and intuitive. The core principle: clarity and consistency through thoughtful design.

## Reference Loading Guide

**ALWAYS load reference files if there is even a small chance the content may be required.** It's better to have the context than to miss a pattern or make a mistake.

| Reference | Load When |
|-----------|-----------|
| **[Interaction](references/interaction.md)** | Touch targets, navigation, layout, hierarchy, or gesture patterns |
| **[Content](references/content.md)** | Empty states, writing copy, typography, or placeholder text |
| **[Visual Design](references/visual-design.md)** | Colors, materials, contrast, dark mode, or SF Symbols |
| **[Accessibility](references/accessibility.md)** | VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, Reduce Motion, or accessibility labels |
| **[Feedback](references/feedback.md)** | Animations, haptics, loading states, or error messages |
| **[Performance](references/performance-platform.md)** | Responsiveness, system components, or app launch |
| **[Privacy](references/privacy-permissions.md)** | Permission requests, data handling, or privacy-sensitive APIs |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Touch targets smaller than 44x44 points** — Buttons and interactive elements must be at least 44x44 points (iOS) to accommodate thumbs. Smaller targets cause frustrated users and accessibility failures.

2. **Ignoring Dynamic Type constraints** — Text with fixed sizes doesn't respect user accessibility settings. Use Dynamic Type sizes, test with Large or Extra Large settings, and avoid hardcoded font sizes.

3. **Insufficient color contrast in dark mode** — Colors that work in light mode may fail accessibility in dark mode. Test with Reduce Contrast accessibility setting enabled for both modes.

4. **Over-animating transitions** — Animations that feel smooth at 60fps can trigger motion sickness in users with vestibular issues. Respect Reduce Motion settings and keep animations under 300ms.

5. **Missing VoiceOver labels on custom controls** — Custom buttons, toggles, or interactive views need `.accessibilityLabel()` and `.accessibilityHint()` or they're completely unusable to screen reader users.

6. **Haptic overuse** — Every action does NOT need haptic feedback. Reserve haptics for confirmations (purchase, critical action) and errors. Excessive haptics are annoying and drain battery.

{"id":"VoiceFlow-06v","title":"Add 'command' voice command with Claude Code chat panel","description":"## What This Feature Is\n\nYou want to **talk to Claude Code through VoiceFlow**. Not dictation - actual delegation. You speak, Claude acts.\n\nRight now VoiceFlow is a **transcription tool** - it turns your voice into keystrokes in whatever app you're focused on. This new feature makes it a **command interface** to an AI agent that can actually do things on your behalf.\n\n---\n\n## The Two Modes\n\n### Mode 1: \"command [whatever]\" - Fire and Forget\n\n```\nYou: \"command write down that I should call Mom tomorrow\"\n     ↓\nClaude Code executes in background\n     ↓\nBrief response appears somehow (TBD)\n     ↓\nYou continue what you were doing\n```\n\n### Mode 2: \"command open\" - Interactive Session\n\n```\nYou: \"command open\"\n     ↓\nChat panel appears\n     ↓\nYou type/talk back and forth with Claude\n     ↓\nFull conversation with tool output visible\n     ↓\n\"command close\" or Escape to dismiss\n```\n\n---\n\n## Why ~/ai-os?\n\nThis isn't a generic Claude instance. It's **your** Claude - the one in ai-os with:\n- Your MCP servers (email, calendar, memory, etc.)\n- Your CLAUDE.md instructions\n- Your tool configurations\n- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` so it can actually act\n\nThe working directory indicator reminds you this is the \"real\" Claude with full capabilities.\n\n---\n\n## The Panel When Open\n\nA **second floating window** (separate from the transcript panel) that's basically a lightweight chat client:\n\n```\n┌─ Command Panel ─────────────────────────┐\n│ 📁 ~/ai-os                    [×]       │  ← Working dir indicator\n├─────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                         │\n│ You: Check my email                     │\n│                                         │\n│ Claude: You have 3 unread emails...     │\n│   ▶ Tool: mcp_gmail_search [collapsed]  │  ← Expandable tool use\n│   ▶ Tool: mcp_gmail_read [collapsed]    │\n│                                         │\n│ You: Reply to the one from Sarah        │\n│                                         │\n│ Claude: Done. I sent: \"Thanks Sarah...\" │\n│   ▶ Tool: mcp_gmail_send [collapsed]    │\n│                                         │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ [Type a message...]            [Send]   │  ← Input at bottom\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Key Properties\n- **Non-activating** - doesn't steal focus from your current app\n- **Lightweight Swift feel** - not a web view, native and fast\n- **Collapsible tool output** - see what Claude did without clutter\n- **Message queue** - can type ahead while waiting for response\n\n---\n\n## The Inline Response Question (Undecided)\n\nWhen you say \"command xyz\" without opening the panel, where does the response go?\n\n### Option C - Overlay on Existing Transcript Panel\n- Response appears as a card in/on the VoiceFlow panel\n- Has \"Open Full\" button if you want more\n- Dismiss to clear\n\n### Option E - Smart Routing\n- Short responses → toast notification\n- Long responses → auto-open the full panel\n- More adaptive, less predictable\n\n---\n\n## Primary Use Cases\n\n1. **\"command check my email and tell me what's important\"**\n   - Claude searches gmail, summarizes\n   - You get a quick answer\n\n2. **\"command write down [idea] and add it to my memory\"**\n   - Claude writes to your memory system\n   - Brief confirmation: \"Added to memory\"\n\n3. **\"command what's on my calendar today\"**\n   - Claude checks calendar MCP\n   - Lists your meetings\n\n4. **\"command open\"** → then interactive conversation\n   - For anything multi-turn\n   - For when you want to see the details\n\n---\n\n## What This Enables\n\nYou're building **voice-first AI assistance**. The pattern is:\n\n1. You're doing something (coding, writing, browsing)\n2. You have a thought or need\n3. You say \"command [thing]\"\n4. It happens\n5. You continue what you were doing\n\n**No context switching. No opening apps. No typing. Just speak and it's done.**\n\n---\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Voice Commands\n- **'command open'** - Opens the command panel for interactive chat\n- **'command close'** - Closes the command panel (Escape key also closes)\n- **'command [text]'** - Executes [text] as immediate command (inline mode)\n\n### New Files to Create\n1. `CommandPanelWindow.swift` - NSPanel subclass (similar to FloatingPanelWindow)\n2. `CommandPanelView.swift` - SwiftUI chat interface\n3. `ClaudeCodeService.swift` - Process management and stdio communication\n4. `CommandMessage.swift` - Model for chat messages\n5. `CommandResponseOverlay.swift` - (if Option C) overlay view for inline responses\n\n### AppState Changes\n- `isCommandPanelVisible: Bool`\n- `commandMessages: [CommandMessage]`\n- `commandPendingInput: String`\n- `claudeCodeService: ClaudeCodeService?`\n- `inlineCommandResponse: CommandMessage?` (for inline mode)\n\n### Claude Code Integration\n- Spawn process: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format stream-json`\n- Working directory: ~/ai-os\n- Pipe stdin for messages, parse stdout for streaming responses\n- Process persists across commands within session\n\n---\n\n## Out of Scope (v1)\n- Voice input directly to command panel (uses keyboard for now)\n- Multiple concurrent sessions\n- Persistent conversation history across app restarts","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-15T12:13:12.874902-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-15T12:26:46.747596-08:00","labels":["command-agent"]}

Enter a special capture mode\n2. Buffer all speech (skip command matching for content)\n3. Wait for stop keyword OR extended silence\n4.

Add FluidAudio SPM dependency: `https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio.git`\n2. Create `FluidAudioService.swift` following the existing service pattern (like AppleSpeechService)\n3. Add `DictationProvider.fluidAudio` or `.parakeet` enum case\n4. Wire up audio capture (already 16kHz mono in AudioCaptureManager - may need Float32 conversion)\n5. Add model download on first use (via `DownloadUtils.loadModels`)\n\n### Considerations\n\n- Models are CC-BY-4.0 licensed (commercial use OK)\n- ~250-600MB download on first use\n- Requires macOS 14.0+ / iOS 17.0+\n- Uses Neural Engine (power efficient)\n- Potentially better accuracy than Apple Speech for dictation\n\n### Sources\n- https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio\n- https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3\n- https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/pushing-the-boundaries-of-speech-recognition-with-nemo-parakeet-asr-models/","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T22:35:55.261731-07:00","updated_at":"2026-01-08T22:36:28.978111-07:00"}
